Youâ€™ll need to use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the Dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Database Models
Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:


Category


id

Integer
Doesn't allow null values
Set as primary key
Use auto increment



category_name

String
Doesn't allow null values





Product


id

Integer
Don't allow null values
Set as primary key
Use auto increment



product_name

String
Doesn't allow null values



price

Decimal
Doesn't allow null values
Validate that the value is a decimal



stock

Integer
Doesn't allow null values
Set a default value of 10
Validate that the value is numeric



category_id

Integer
Reference the category model's id






Tag


id

Integer
Don't allow null values
Set as primary key
Use auto increment



tag_name

String





ProductTag


id

Integer
Don't allow null values
Set as primary key
Use auto increment



product_id

Integer
Reference the product model's id




tag_id

Integer
Reference the tag model's id







Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:


Product belongs to Category, as a Category can have multiple Products but a Product can only belong to one Category


Category has many Product


Product belongs to many Tag, using the ProductTag through model, allow Products to have multiple Tags and Tags have many Products


Tag belongs to many Product



Hint: Make sure you set up foreign key relationships that match the column we created in the respective models.


Fill out the API Routes to Perform RESTful CRUD Operations
Fill out the unfinished routes in product-routes.js, tag-routes.js, and category-routes.js to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using your Sequelize models.

Note: The functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products is already done for you.


Hint: Be sure to look at your module project's code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what req.body will be for POST and PUT routes!


Seed the Database
After creating the models and routes, run npm run seed to seed data to your database so you can test your routes.

Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start
Create the code needed in server.js to sync our Sequelize models to our MySQL database on server start.
